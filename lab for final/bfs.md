Explanation:

Create a graph.
Initialize a starting node.
Send the graph and initial node as parameters to the bfs function.
Mark the initial node as visited and push it into the queue.
Explore the initial node and add its neighbours to the queue and remove the initial node from the queue.
Check if the neighbours node of a neighbouring node is already visited.
If not, visit the neighbouring node neighbours and mark them as visited.
Repeat this process until all the nodes in a graph are visited and the queue becomes empty.
